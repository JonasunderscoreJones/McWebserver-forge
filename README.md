# Forge port development has ended
The Fabric/Quilt continues to be supported at the [fabric repository](https://github.com/J-onasJones/McWebserver)

# McWebserver Forge
A simple webserver that runs alongside the Minecraft Server (Forge version).

This is the forge repository of the *McWebserver* project. For more information about the mod go to the [fabric repository](https://github.com/J-onasJones/McWebserver).


### Maintainance statement
My primary focus lies on the fabric version of this project. If oneday I decide to not continue porting this mod to forge, then this here port will be discontinued. (Just beware)
